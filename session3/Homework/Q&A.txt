1. What is nested list?
A list is called "nested" when it is contained inside another list.

2. Can a list store both integers and strings in it?
Yes, the elements of the list do not have to be the same type.
It can contain different types such as a string, a float, an integer or even another list inside it.
e.g: 
hoa = ["skinny", "short", 18, ["German", "English"]]
