1. warmup.py:
"1989" (int()) = oke
"asd" => false
- Validate User Input?
- Re-enter

- hàm ".isdigit()" = to check whether a data is a digit or not?
=> hàm boolean
e.g: yob = int(input("Enter a number: ")
1. When a digit => True
2. Wenn not a digit => False
(Can be used after hàm if)

- Refactor => make the code become more easier to read and to fix later without changing it

2. while_intro.py:
- Loop with the unknown number of loop range: "WHILE" - Infinite loop
Ctrl C = exit the loop
while True: => infinite loop
while False: => not run => hàm useless

Loop_counter: count the number of loop (count)
loop_counter = 0 => when the loop has not run => the number of loop is 0
 - "break" has effect with the nearest upper loop

3. menu.py:
- Codes that cannot be changed directly: not scalable
=> hàm "list"
used for homogenous items, infinite
Operations:
- CRUD? Create Read Update Delete
* C - Create: Add more items to menu
* R - Read: Allow users to see the data without changing it
* U - Update: change an item's content
* D - Delete: Remove an item from the menu
List usually has 's' => notice that after that is a list

Trong append must be a data of any type
Index and most of the program language counts from 0 and python allows coder to run around (e.g: 0 1 2 -1 -2 -3) and allow only 2 times => the last element: [-1]
- new line: "\n"

4. delete.py:
- Delete theo location: fill in the location of the element that you want to delete
- Delete theo content: fill in the exact content of the element that you want to delete
